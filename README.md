# cassandra2lmp

Simple code to convert a .xyz file to lammps topology. It basically guess the bonds and angles using cassadra. Bonds and angles with same atomic number are ignored (H-H or O-O are ignored, H-O-H works fine).

The current code pipeline is:

```mermaid
graph LR
A[.xyz with steps]  --> B[extract last .xyz] --> C[split to two .xyz's, water and silica] --> D[.xyz to .pdb] --> Ã‰[use utils/pdb2lmp.py to generate the topologies]
```
